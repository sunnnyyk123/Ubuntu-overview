## 1. Introduction

This document provides a structured and easy-to-understand overview of Ubuntu. It explains what Ubuntu is, why it's used, its core features, and how to get started.

---
## 2. What is Ubuntu?

Ubuntu is an open-source, Linux-based operating system developed by Canonical Ltd. in 2004. Ubuntu is designed to be easy to use, highly secure, and reliable.

Ubuntu is widely used on personal computers, servers, and in cloud computing.

---
## 3. Why Ubuntu?

- **Free & Open Source:** Ubuntu is completely free to download, use, and share. Its source code is open to everyone, allowing users and developers to view, modify, and contribute.

- **Secure:** Ubuntu is highly secure. It comes with a built-in firewall (ufw), user-privilege management, and receives regular security patches from Canonical.

- **Package Management:** Installing, updating, and removing software is easy using Ubuntu's package management tools like `apt` and `snap`.

- **Community Support:** Ubuntu has one of the largest and most active open-source communities. If you are stuck with an error or looking for a tutorial, help is available through forums like Ask Ubuntu, Stack Overflow, and the official documentation of Ubuntu.

- **DevOps & Cloud Ready:** Ubuntu is widely used in cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP. It is a top choice for running DevOps tools like Ansible, Terraform, and Jenkins.

## 5. Software Management in Ubuntu

Ubuntu uses various tools to manage software packages efficiently.

### 5.1. APT
APT (Advanced Package Tool) is a command-line tool for installing, updating, and removing `.deb` packages.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install <package-name>
sudo apt remove <package-name>
```

### 5.2. Snap Package Manager
`snap` is a command-line tool for installing, updating, and removing Snap packages (self-contained apps).

```bash
sudo snap install <package-name>
sudo snap refresh <package-name>
sudo snap remove <package-name>
```

## 6. Services in Ubuntu

Services or daemons in Ubuntu are managed using `systemd`, the default `init` system.

### 6.1. Understanding systemd

`systemd` is the default init system used in Ubuntu. It is responsible for managing the system's boot-up process, controlling the lifecycle of services (such as starting, stopping, enabling, and disabling them), and handling logging and service dependencies. `systemd` ensures that services start in the correct order and provides powerful tools for monitoring and managing system processes efficiently.

### 6.2. Common Service Commands

Use `systemctl` to manage services:

```bash
# Start a service
sudo systemctl start <service-name>

# Stop a service
sudo systemctl stop <service-name>

# Restart a service
sudo systemctl restart <service-name>

# Enable a service (auto-start at boot)
sudo systemctl enable <service-name>

# Disable a service
sudo systemctl disable <service-name>

# Check service status
systemctl status <service-name>

# List all active services
systemctl list-units --type=service
```

### 6.3. Essential Ubuntu Services

| Service Name | Description                             |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `networking` | Manages network interfaces              |
| `ssh`        | Enables remote SSH access               |
| `cron`       | Schedules tasks (cron jobs)             |
| `snapd`      | Snap package manager background service |
